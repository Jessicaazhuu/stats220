This was made with the purpose of a practice repo as I start learning and using Markdown. I practiced using Markdown syntax within this repo and just for fun, I have decided to dedicate it to cats 🐈

First, here are some things about me:
- My name is Jessica Zhu
- I am a student studying Data Science at the University of Auckland

## Welcome!
Do you like cats? ≽^- ˕ -^≼ 

Well I do, so here's ✧˖° <ins>*5 Fun Facts about Cats*</ins> ✧˖° :
1. Cats spend around 1/3 of their lives sleeping, usually sleeping around 12 - 20 hours in a day. Must be nice...
2. Like how most humans have a dominant hand, cats can also have a dominant front paw. Studies have shown that male cats tend to have a dominant left paw, while female cats tend to have a dominant right paw.
3. Cats have 32 muscles in each ear, which allows their ears to move separately, turn 180 degrees and detect where a specific sound is coming from.
4. While the average person can have around 9,000 taste buds that can taste sweetness, sourness, bitterness, saltiness and savory, a cat has around 473 taste buds and can taste all that a person can, apart from sweetness.
5. A cat's flexibility comes from having around 53 vertebrae, including in the tail, while humans ony have around 33 vertebrae.

**Woo!** 
Hope you enjoyed those cat facts, I know I did. /ᐠ o ˕ oマ 

My stats lecturer used a link that brought me much joy as it presents you a random photo of a cat everytime you refresh it, so I will now share the joy of [many cats](https://cataas.com/cat). =^. ̫.^=
